# Basic Inventory Manager (BIM)

A script for the game Space Engineers that handles inventories. 

>This script is a work in progress. I don't know if I'll post it to the workshop yet.
You are free to use it in ships you build, including ones uploaded to the workshop, but please don't upload the script on its own to the workshop. I'd like to retain that privilege. Thank you.

It can:
* Sort items into 4 categories.
* Does not touch inventories that aren't tagged\*
* Limited export to other grids capabilities
* Auto queue items to the assembler (including disassembly)

\* Except for the connected connector when exporting and assembler queueing.

It has 2 main goals:
* Minimal performance impact
* Be simple to use
